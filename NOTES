TODO

 - step numbers
 - step action type "portal, ada/jarvis, link etc"
 - field counts
 - key counts/requirements

 - add implied steps for visiting portal to light it up/farm keys

 - import/export plan to textfile

 - move a selection of steps to a new location

 - audit plan for problems
 	- crossed links
 	- blockers
 	- SBUL needed
 	- link amps needed?


- fix clobbering on delete line and import


Good Ideas
==========
 - portal list tab
 - cache portalnames for steps in localstorage/textfile
 - sort by north/south/east/west
 - move all links from one portal to another (move anchor)
